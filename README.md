# vw-cdc-emulator-arduino
Emulator of VW/Skoda/Audi CD Changer protocol, built for Arduino

For now it can only present itself as a CD changer and set an arbitrary CD/Track number.

There's a [Sigrok](https://sigrok.org/) sample session file and a protocol decoder for DATA OUT in [sigrok](./sigrok) directory.
